To do this, we are going to have you develop a game! The game is called High-Low and the way it's played goes as follows:\n","# Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent. You can see your number, but not the computer's!\n","# You make a guess, saying your number is either higher than or lower than the computer's number\n","# If your guess matches the truth (ex. you guess your number is higher, and then your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!\n","# These steps make up one round of the game. The game is over after all rounds have been played.\n","# We've provided a sample run below.\n","# Welcome to the High-Low Game!\n","# --------------------------------\n","# Round 1\n","# Your number is 8\n","# Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower\n","# You were right!
