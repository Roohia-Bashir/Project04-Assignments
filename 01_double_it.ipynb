Your program will then double that number and print out the result. It will repeat that process until the value is 100 or greater.\n","# For example if the user enters the number 2 you would then print:\n","# 4 8 16 32 64 128\n","# Note that:\n","# 2 doubled is 4\n","# 4 doubled is 8\n","# 8 doubled is 16\n","# and so on.\n","# We stop at 128 because that value is greater than 100.\n","# Maintain the current number in a variable named curr_value. When you double the number, you should be updating curr_value. Recall that you can double the value of curr_value using a line like:\n","# curr_value = curr_value * 2\n","# This program should have a while loop and the while loop condition should test if curr_value is less than 100. Thus, your program will have the line:\n","# while curr_value < 100:\n","# Starter Code\n","# def main():\n","#     print(\"Delete this line and write your code here! :)\")\n","# # This provided line is required at the end of\n","# # Python file to call the main() function.\n","# if __name__ == '__main__':\n","#     main()\n","# Solution\n","\n","def main():\n","    while True:\n","        try:\n","            curr_value = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n","            break\n","        except ValueError:\n","            print(\"Invalid input.
